# static-node-and-express-site

This project is my solution for the sixth task for Teamtreehouse's "Fullstack JavaScript Techdegree".

The task was to create a portfolio site presenting some of my projects, using Node.js, Express and Pug.

In the given CSS design stylesheet I changed/added the following:

-   font-family, font-size, text-align and text-transform for the h5 (name) in the sidebar
-   color for the '.portfolio-intro h5' and for the '.cell h5'
-   background-color for 'article', '.wrapper' and '.box'
